# Introducing Q-Term
An information terminal for the savvy Chief of Staff, data scientist, trader, CEO, etc.
Pretty much **anybody** who needs convenient access to data and analysis, but without all of the overhead of Bloomberg.

Enter your preferences in the Python file, and ensure you have the required packages in requirements.txt installed.

### Current commands supported:
- `E equity_name` where `equity_name` is the ticker of a public equity, *e.g. MS, AAPL,* etc.
- `F currency_name` where `currency_name` is the short name of a currency, *e.g. HKD, EUR,* etc.
- `N nation_name` where `nation_name` is the name of a country, *e.g. USA, Canada, South Korea,* etc.
- `C city_name` where `city_name` is the name of a city, *e.g. Hong Kong, New York, Paris,* etc.
- `Q` = quit

Future commands hopefully to be added soon.
